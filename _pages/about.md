# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in **Engineering Systems and Design** at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), jointly pursuing a doctoral program with the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research focuses on **operations research, prescriptive analytics, and high-dimensional statistics**, with applications in **newsvendor problems, resource-sharing networks, and platform economics**.  

I am particularly interested in:
- High-dimensional prescriptive analytics (e.g., Estimate-then-Optimize, Integrated Learning‚ÄìOptimization, Direct Policy Optimization).
- Convex optimization, distributionally robust optimization, and the Convex Gaussian Min‚ÄìMax Theorem (CGMT).
- Modeling and optimization of large-scale **transportation and resource-sharing systems** (e.g., bike-sharing, EV battery-swapping, and ride-hailing).
