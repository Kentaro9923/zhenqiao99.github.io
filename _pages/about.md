# About Me

I am a second year PhD candidate in **Engineering Systems and Design Pillar** at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) supervised by Prof. Xiaotang Yang(https://xiaotangyang.com/) and Prof. Karthyek Murthy(https://sites.google.com/site/karthyekswebpage/). My research focuses on applied probability including two variant, One is  prescriptive analytics under high-dimensional statistics, with applications in inventory problems, portofolio problems. Another is large queueing networks in service science. 

I am particularly interested in:
- High-dimensional prescriptive analytics 
- stochastic optimization, distributionally robust optimization, and the Convex Gaussian Min‚ÄìMax Theorem (CGMT).
-large-scale transportation and resource-sharing systems (e.g., bike-sharing, EV battery-swapping, and ride-hailing).
