# About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the **Engineering Systems and Design Pillar** at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), supervised by [Prof. Xiaotang Yang](https://xiaotangyang.com) and [Prof. Karthyek Murthy](https://sites.google.com/site/karthyekswebpage/).  

My research focuses on **applied probability** in two directions:  
1. **Prescriptive analytics under high-dimensional statistics**, with applications in inventory management and portfolio optimization.  
2. **Large-scale queueing networks in service science**, with applications to transportation and resource-sharing systems.  

I am particularly interested in:
- High-dimensional prescriptive analytics  
- Stochastic optimization, distributionally robust optimization, and the Convex Gaussian Min‚ÄìMax Theorem (CGMT)  
- Large-scale transportation and resource-sharing systems (e.g., bike-sharing, EV battery-swapping, ride-hailing)
